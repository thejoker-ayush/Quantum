# 🏄‍QUANTUM MANIA

### Hi there 👋

Here, I present my quantum profile, where I would like to portray a little bit of my knowledge in the study of the quantum realm... :P 

As I graduated with a Master's in advanced physics with my final thesis project in satellite quantum key distribution and fascination of quantum computing led me to an obsession of learning more and thus, I took up a few projects to get into more detail. 

Moreover, with an analytical coding enthusiasm, you may find relevant quantum algorithms associated with different kinds of problems and some githib problems which were fascinating to me.


Here are some ideas to get you started:
